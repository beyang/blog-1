After dragging my JSON implementation through various projects, and
having several incompatible versions exist at the same time, I got
permission to open-source it from the [company][st] that originally
paid me to write it, so it has a home now: [ST-JSON][stjson].

There already exists a comparable library called [CL-JSON][cljson]. I
originally wrote a new one because the way CL-JSON uses `nil` to
encode all of boolean false, the empty list, and the empty object was
causing headaches, and later I added some other extensions.
