After messing around with a few different client-side templating
libraries, all of which seemed to be either unmaintained, too
overbearing (forcing you to work inside their 'framework'), or just
plain wrongheaded, I went ahead and implemented a new one. Mold aims
to be a simple, general, convenient system for compiling and
instantiating HTML templates. See the [project page][mold] for
examples, documentation and downloads.
